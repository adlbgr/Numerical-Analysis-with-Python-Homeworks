### Numerical Analysis Homework Series

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks for numerical analysis tasks as part of homework assignments.

---

### **1. HW1.ipynb**
Covers solving a system of linear equations using the Gauss-Seidel method, deriving Lagrange polynomials, and performing quadratic curve fitting. Includes both manual calculations and Python implementations.

### **2. HW2.ipynb**
Focuses on finding roots of a transcendental equation using bisection, Newton-Raphson, and secant methods. Provides performance comparisons of each method with varying tolerances and iterations.

### **3. HW3.ipynb**
Includes numerical differentiation using the four-point method, integration using Trapezoidal and Simpson's rules, and solving an initial value problem with the Runge-Kutta method.
